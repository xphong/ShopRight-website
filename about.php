                <p>People love working at ShopRight because it's a place where you can be yourself, be heard and be respected while enjoying a work-life balance. Another reason is that ShopRight is a co-op. Rather than thinking quarter to quarter, we can take the long view and focus on what's best for our members, while conducting business in a way that's socially and environmentally responsible. We're crazy about enjoying the outdoors, and we're just as committed to leaving it in good hands for future generations.
                    </p><p>If that sounds like the place where you'd want to work and the kind of people you'd like to work with, please take a closer look at what we have to offer.
